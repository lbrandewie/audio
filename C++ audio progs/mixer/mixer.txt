Mixer is an app that allows you to mix two wave files together.

You specify two wave files to mix, along with the offset and level
of the second file, and (optionally) normalization level and pan.

Level and normalization level are specified in decibels. Pan can
range from -1 (full left) to 1 (full right). Pan is only significant
if the 2nd file mentioned is mono and the first is stereo.
Offset is measured in seconds.

If the files differ in format, the first file mentioned controls
the characteristics of the output file. Both must be 16-bit files.

If the mix results in clipping and no normalization level is 
specified, clipping will be detected and reported.
