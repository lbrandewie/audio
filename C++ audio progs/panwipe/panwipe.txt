Panwipe is a program that does "stupid pan tricks" (if you will) on mono
wave files, resulting in stereo wave files. You specify the wavefile,
the delay before the effect starts, cycle time (the length of a cycle
in seconds), the pattern, and optionally the number of cycles.

Pattern can be one of four possibilities. The LR setting starts the
effect on the left channel, then moves it to the right (and possibly
back again). The RL setting does the opposite. The CR setting starts
at the center, then goes right (and optionally back again). The CL
setting also starts in the center, but moves left initially.

usage: panwipe wavefile delay cycletime pattern [cycles]
