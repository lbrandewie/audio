Hey Everyone,

This is my first C++ project, and I think it came out pretty well.
I've been doing C since time began, and doing OOP in perl for many
years, so it wasn't that big of an adjustment.

I wrote three classes to simplify digital audio work. The Buffer class
is where most of the code wound up. It represents a buffer in which 
samples are stored. Wavefile and CDaudio classes are derived from
Buffer, which simplify working with those file types.

I managed to eliminate five classes (one base and four derived classes)
by treating buffers as being full of primitive types (shorts and floats)
rather than "Sample" - class objects. I got the benefit I was looking
for there by using eight functions in Buffer.cpp (they start with get or
set, left or right channel, 16- or 32-bit) which allow the samples to be
addressed by sample number and channel, rather than absolute position in
the buffer.

The other thing you need to compile these examples is my library file
GlobalProcs.cpp and its header. These are found in the Audio Class & 
Library files folder in the distribution.

If you download both the C and C++ versions of the applications, you
will likely notice that the C++ versions are noticeably larger. I think
it's size well spent, since the code is so much easier to maintain 
and modify. There is no noticeable speed difference between the 
different versions.

Please send bug reports or other feedback to lars@piumasoft.com.

Thanks,
