StereoFX is a program that allows you to change the stereo
image of a file. The file must, of course, be stereo.

You specify the input file and the decibel setting, and,
optionally, a normalization level. The program then loads
the file, converts to mid-sides, amplifies the sides and 
then reconverts to stereo. This has the effect of enhancing
the stereo image of the file.

If no normalization level is specified and clipping occurs,
it will be detected and reported.

usage: stereofx wavefile decibels [normlevel]
