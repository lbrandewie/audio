Msa is a program that does mid-sides analysis on stereo wave files.

Stereo wave files can be looked at in two different ways. You can 
consider them to be separate channels (the usual view), or you can
view them as a "mono" part (called the "mid" information) and the 
"stereo" part (called the "sides" information). Msa simply reports 
on the level in decibels of the mid and sides information.

The mid part is defined as the average of the channels. The sides
(in this software) is calculated as the right channel minus the mid.
