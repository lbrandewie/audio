Delay is a fairly simple program that implements a digital 
delay effect. You can specify the source file, the delay in
milliseconds, the level at which to mix in the delayed audio,
and a normalization level if desired. All level settings are 
(of course) in decibels. Delay is measured in milliseconds.

If the operation results in clipping and no normalization
level is specified, clipping will be detected and reported.
