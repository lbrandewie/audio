Hey Everyone,

These are some digital audio programs that I wrote in C a few months ago.

The programs operate on 16-bit wave (.wav) and CDaudio files (.cda or .cdaudio).
I personally saw no reason to support 8-bit audio, as my experience with it
is that it sounds pretty lousy. I also had no 24-bit files with which to work,
so 24-bit audio is not supported either. Sorry about that.

The main idea behind creating these files was to take the audio work very
seriously. I use 16-bit buffers (short integers, to be specific) only if
no large number of samples will be touched more than once. If that is the
case, I use 32-bit floating-point buffers instead. That way, intermediate 
results can be stored in a floating-point format. This results in the 
minimum deterioration to the signal quality that I believe possible.

The programs are fairly well tested, but bugs are certainly possible. Send
bug reports or other feedback to lars@piumasoft.com, please.

Thanks!
