Paver is a simple program that creates blank wave files.
You specify the name of the wave file, the duration in 
seconds, the sample rate, and (optionally) the number
of channels.

You use the -t option to set time, the -s option to set
sample rate, and the -c option to set the number of channels.

Number of channels defaults to two if not specified.

usage: paver wavfile [options]

options: -t (sets time), -s (sets sample rate) and -c (sets channels)
