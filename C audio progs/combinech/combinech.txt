Combinech is a program that can combine two mono .wav files into one stereo file.
If one of the files is shorter (in terms of samples) than the other, the shorter
one will be padded as necessary. If there is a mismatch in settings between files,
the file mentioned first determines the characteristics of the output file. The
first wavefile mentioned becomes the left channel, while the second becomes
the right.

usage: combinech wavefile1 wavefile2
